# RemEMBER

The idea behind this app was to create a notepad-like app in Ember with full CRUD functionality. On top of the fact that Ember was a entirely new framework to work with, developers were not to have commit rights to the master branch. 

Thus, all changes had to be made through pull requests that were reviewed by instructors and merged into master when approved. Aside from learning a new JS framework, this project was largely focused on dialing development github workflow, ensuring a smooth process of communicating what new features are made or worked on in all future projects. Some examples include, structuring a commit message properly, pulling down master a master version of the app as it is officially approved, and cherry-picking old commits to merge into the latest version of the app. I have never been so confident with and grateful for how github works. This has been a great lesson in learning how real projects are managed and seeing which methods of working through issues and features works most seamlessly.
